## Backend API Endpoints Used

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/teacher/register` - Teacher registration
- `POST /api/auth/teacher/login` - Teacher login
- `POST /api/auth/student/register` - Student registration
- `POST /api/auth/student/login` - Student login

### Content Management
- `POST /api/teacher/upload` - Upload documents/audio (requires: school, class, subject, topic, file/audio)
- `GET /api/notes` - Fetch notes with filters
- `POST /api/tts` - Generate audio from text
- `POST /api/ai` - AI-powered Q&A

## How to Use

### For Teachers:
1. **Register/Login**: Use simplified registration with just name, email, password, and optional school
2. **Upload Content**: 
   - Select between Document or Audio upload
   - Choose class level (6-12)
   - Select subject
   - Enter topic name (required)
   - Upload file
   - System will automatically generate audio for documents

### For Students:
1. **Login**: Use appropriate student type login
2. **View Content**: Dashboard automatically loads relevant notes based on class/subject
3. **Adaptive UI**: Interface adapts based on student type:
   - Visually Impaired: Audio-focused with TTS
   - Hearing Impaired: Visual-focused interface
   - Speech Impaired: Text input focused
   - Slow Learner: Simplified, step-by-step interface

## Running the Application

### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```
Backend runs on: http://localhost:5000

### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5174

## Database Requirements:
