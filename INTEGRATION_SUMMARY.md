## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at: http://localhost:5174

2. **Test Teacher Flow**:
   - Click "Login / Register" on home page
   - Select "I'm a Teacher"
   - Click "Login to Existing Account"
   - Use demo credentials or click "Use Demo Credentials"
   - After login, you'll be redirected to teacher dashboard
   - Try uploading a file with class/subject/topic

3. **Test Student Flow**:
   - Click "Login / Register" on home page
   - Select "I'm a Student"
   - Login or register with student credentials
   - Access adaptive dashboard based on student type
   - View notes and ask questions

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Backend Hosting**: The backend is hosted on Render's free tier, which may have cold starts (initial request may take 30-60 seconds)

2. **AI Features**: AI features (notes generation, Q&A) require proper API keys configured in the backend environment

3. **File Limits**: 
   - Maximum file size: 16MB
   - Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MP3, WAV, M4A

4. **CORS**: The backend is configured to accept requests from any origin for development

5. **JWT Tokens**: Tokens expire after 12 hours and need re-authentication

## ‚ú® Features Working

- ‚úÖ Teacher registration and login
- ‚úÖ Student registration and login  
- ‚úÖ File upload with metadata
- ‚úÖ Dynamic subject loading
- ‚úÖ AI-powered notes generation
- ‚úÖ Context-aware Q&A
- ‚úÖ Adaptive UI for different student types

- ‚úÖ Logout functionality

## üîÑ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Cold Start**: First request to backend may be slow due to free tier hosting
2. **AI Keys**: AI features won't work without proper API keys in backend
3. **File Processing**: Large files may timeout on free tier
4. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation yet

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
2. Implement loading states for all async operations
3. Add toast notifications for better UX
4. Implement file preview functionality
5. Add progress tracking for students
6. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
7. Add pagination for large data sets
8. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
